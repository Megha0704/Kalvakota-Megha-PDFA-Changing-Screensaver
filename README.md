# Changing-Screensaver

## Repository
https://github.com/Megha0704/PDFA-Proposal.git

## Description
My project should change between different pieces of predetermined artworks. The relevance will be that it is a graphic that can be interacted with on a full screen of device.

## Features
- Full Screen
	- When the program is run, the screen will automatically take over the full screen.
- Manual Switch Between Art
	- When a key on the keyboard is clicked, the artwork on the screen will automatically change.
- Personal Imagers
  - If the user wishes to add their own images they will be able to do so
- Image Changing 
  - If the user wishes they can change the look of the image color or orientation 

## Challenges
- I will need to research different artworks that I would like to keep in the library
- I will also need to figure out how to load multiple images into a library
- Coding a key to be used to manually change the screensaver

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The screen will automatically load as a full screen and minimize.
- Artwork will show up in the correct format and pixelation
- Button to change artworks will work properly
- User will be able to interact with the user interface properly

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Code will automatically pull up a full screen.
- Screensaver will automatically change artworks on its own
