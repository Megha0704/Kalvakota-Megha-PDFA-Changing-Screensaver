## Description
This project focuses on changing the appearance of a screensaver at will. It could help users who are like me who want a new screensaver but don't want to go through the hassle of manually searching for new images. I really like the concept of this project because a simple click of a button transforms your entire screen with color and if you really desire, you can add your own images to give the project a personal touch. 

Changing between grayscale to inverted colors then back to regular colors is very eyecatching. However, my favorite feature has to be the 'a' button. When pressed, the 'a' button prompts the user through the terminal for a file path. I like this feature, because when coding I added some "flare" to the dialog that is displayed. little things such as a :( to show a sad face or !! because the file upload was successful, it also feels like I personally am telling the user "I'm happy that my program worked for you, and that you can personalize it to your liking."

For this project I had to go back through lectures to relearn grayscale, screens, etc. I also had to research different PILs such as 'shutil' and 'os' to try and get the right outcome for my project. Everytime I got each individual part to start working, I would be so thrilled with myself for properly getting the code right and the hirearchy right. Each individual component brought it's fair share of challenges, some crashing my computer, others just made the program unusable. Thoroughout this process of being successful then failing again, I learned to be accepting of the journey to success.
